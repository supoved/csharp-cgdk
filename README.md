#My AI strategy for Russian AI Cup 2014

That year it was a hokey game [CodeHockey](http://russianaicup.ru/p/CodeHockey)

The strategy took [132 place out of 1576](http://russianaicup.ru/profile/supoved)

##Overview
It is fork of C# game runner. Which also contains my AI strategy implementation.

It was a fun project with very simple implementation. Strategy can not learn or do something fancy.
It is literally just a number of rules to follow.

A point of interest. It includes project to run test games N times (in background) against previous version of strategy.
Running tests against new strategy helped a lot to find not obvious problems and good solutions.
And see statistics if new strategy is performing better over N games.
